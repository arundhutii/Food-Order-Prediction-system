This is a group project which involves creating a machine learning model to predict daily demand based on past order data. 
By forecasting future orders, businesses can optimize inventory, reduce waste, and better meet customer needs.

The project demonstrates how simple machine learning techniques like linear regression or time series analysis can improve operational efficiency.
